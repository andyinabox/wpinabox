Starter Wordpress Project
==========================

Developed by Andy Dayton.

Dependencies
------------

I'm using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install PHP dependencies, but I usually include plugins, etc. in the repo just to be safe.

### Themes

* [Site Theme](wp-content/themes/wpinabox-theme/) (click through to see theme setup info)

### Plugins

* [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
* [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber) for templating
