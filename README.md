WPinabox Project
==========================

Developed by Andy Dayton.

Setup
------

See the instructions for [wpinabox-stack](https://github.com/andyinabox/wpinabox-stack) to bootstrap this project on [VVV 2](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).

Once your project is in place, you can run the `init.sh` script to customize your template.


Dependencies
------------

I'm using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install PHP dependencies, but I usually include plugins, etc. in the repo just to be safe.

### Themes

* [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
* [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber) for templating
