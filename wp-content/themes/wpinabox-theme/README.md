WPinabox Theme
=======================

Development
------------

Some notes on the dev setup:

 * [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for development & builds
 * [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styles
 * [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for the latest js sugar
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for dependency management
 * [Timber](https://timber.github.io/timber/) and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/templates.html) for templating

To install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

To run development server (with proxy):

```
yarn start
```

To build all assets:

```
yarn run build
```

_(If you don't have yarn installed you can substitute `npm` in the above commands and they'll still work)_
